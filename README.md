# UniFi + OPNSense
I like my UniFi access point and ethernet switches. I'm less impressed with their firewall/router offerings. So I have a comodity x86 machine running OPNSense. Mixing more than one ecosystem always comes with unique challenges. So as I solve them, I'll post them here in hopes someone else may find the information useful.

See the [docs](docs) on GitHub Pages.
